== Privacy ==

Evie uses LocalStorage to save the setting when the Dark Mode support is turned on or off.
LocalStorage is only used when a visitor (who isn't logged in) clicks on the Dark Mode button.
For a logged in user, the setting will be saved to the user's metadata in the database instead.
Unlike Cookies, data stored in LocalStorage is never transferred to the server.
